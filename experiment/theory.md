An Eye Diagram is a powerful tool used in digital communication to visualize how well a digital signal can be interpreted by a receiver. It is obtained by overlapping multiple bits of a digital signal to form a composite view.

 If Using Lab Equipment:
Connect the signal generator to the digital communication kit.

Select the desired pulse encoding type.

Use an oscilloscope in persistence mode.

Trigger on the bit clock to overlay multiple bits.

Capture and freeze the Eye Diagram.

Analyze parameters like eye opening, jitter, and noise margin.


Result:
Eye diagram patterns for various digital pulses were successfully obtained and analyzed. The differences in eye opening and jitter show the impact of encoding schemes on signal integrity.
