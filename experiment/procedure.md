Generate a binary data stream (e.g., 101100110).

Apply different line coding techniques (NRZ, RZ, Manchester).

Pass the signal through a pulse shaping filter (optional).

Add noise or delay (to simulate channel impairments).

Use an eye diagram plotting function to overlay signal slices.

Observe and analyze the Eye Diagram shape for each coding type.
